Neural synthesis of images and videos by stimulating channels in convolutional networks


References & background research
-----

This technique grew out of deep learning research from 2012-2014 which aimed to improve our ability to interpret the activations and learned representations of convolutional networks, computational models which were rapidly gaining success in computer vision in that period.
