Audio sculptures fabricated during [Art Hack Day](http://arthackday.net/) at [319 Scholes](http://319scholes.org/) in January 2012. The sculpture below is a spectrogram of Billy Joel's *Scenes From an Italian Restaurant* frozen in time. Each cross-section of the sculpture, moving upward through time is a representation of the frequency peaks at that moment in the song. It was printed using a [Makerbot](http://www.makerbot.com/) and Marius Watz' [Model-building library](http://workshop.evolutionzone.com/2011/04/06/code-modelbuilder-library-public-release/) for Processing.
