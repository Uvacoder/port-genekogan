The [Manta](http://www.snyderphonics.com/products.htm) is a touch-sensitive controller built by [Jeff Snyder](http://www.scattershot.org) of [Snyderphonics](http://www.snyderphonics.com) containing 48 capacitive touch sensors and LED switches, two sliders, and four buttons. It is an expressive controller which has been used in a [variety of ways](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=manta+snyderphonics) to interact with live audio and video. Since 2014, I am maintaining [two software libraries](https://github.com/genekogan/Manta) for interfacing with the Manta in performance.
	
MantaOSC is a standalone OSX application for interfacing with the Manta and sending OSC messages to control other applications. Manta users can [download the application here](https://github.com/genekogan/Manta/releases).

[MantaLearn](https://github.com/genekogan/Manta/tree/master/MantaLearn) is an experimental application, currently under development, for training the Manta input data to parametrically control other instruments using [neural networks](https://www.nips4creativity.com://genekogan.com/works/ofxLearn.html) (w.i.p.).
