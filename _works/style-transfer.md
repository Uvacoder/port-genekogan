Style transfer is the technique of recomposing images in the style of other images. These were mostly created using [Justin Johnson's code](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style) based on the [paper by Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) demonstrating a method for restyling images using convolutional neural networks. Instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/genekogan/d61c8010d470e1dbe15d), and more details [here](https://gitxiv.com/posts/jG46ukGod8R7Rdtud/a-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style). A gallery with all of these and more style transfers can be [viewed here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/genekogan/albums/72157658785675071).

Pablo Picasso [painting on glass in 1937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkRS3wDg1xU), restyled by works from his Blue, African, and Cubist periods respectively.

A more recent [implementation for video style transfer](http://github.com/manuelruder/artistic-videos), with improved frame-to-frame stability by adding an optical-flow-based loss term to the normal content/style reconstruction loss terms. Based on [the paper and code by Manuel Ruder et al](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08610). Van Gogh / Hokusai / Google Maps / Basquiat applied to a [video overlooking Manhattan from the J-train](http://instagram.com/p/6tBxonA4pw/?taken-by=genekogan).

Cubist Mirror was an installation made for [alt-ai](http://www.alt-ai.net), demonstrating near real-time style transfer on the webcam feed, based on the [paper by Johnson, Alahi, and Li](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155) and using the [chainer implementation](https://github.com/yusuketomoto/chainer-fast-neuralstyle) by Yusuke Tomoto, trained on a generic cubist painting.

An HD (1920x1080) style transfer of a tree restyled by Hokusai, then Arabic calligraphy, using [Mike Tyka's](http://www.miketyka.com/) [patch-based fork](http://github.com/mtyka/neural_artistic_style) of the implementation by [Anders Boesen Lindbo Larsen](https://github.com/andersbll/neural_artistic_style).
