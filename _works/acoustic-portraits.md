Acoustic Portraits was a video piece made with Angely Chi during my residency with [The UnifiedField](http://www.theunifiedfield.org/archives/3471) in Davao, Philippines, and exhibited at [Fete Dela WSK](http://www.fetedelawsk.com) in Manila, November 2013. A recording of four local musicians from Davao City playing a mix of traditional and world instruments was time-stretched to 1/10th of the original speed to create a portrait of their music.

With [time stretching software](http://hypermammut.sourceforge.net/paulstretch/) we can nearly freeze the sound, bringing out rich qualities in the timbre of the instruments that are otherwise too transient to hear at normal playback.

Thanks to our musicians:

- Neil Cervantes // hegalong, flute
- Anne Mendoza // kalimba, guitar
- Romar Cinto // djembe, kubing, rainstick
- El Felicilda // djembe, bird flute

Thanks to Angely Chi, [Marta Moreno Mu√±oz](http://theunifiedfield.net/), AVL Studio, Gloryrose Dy, Glorypearl Dy, Marben Picar, Baian Lindo-Valdez, and Lulu Amorado for their support and contributions.
