These are some experiments made using [Deep Generator Networks (DGN)](http://www.evolvingai.org/synthesizing) code by [Nguyen, Dosovitskiy, Yosinski, Brox, and Clune](http://www.evolvingai.org/files/nguyen2016synthesizing.pdf) at [Evolving-AI](http://www.evolvingai.org/). DGNs are a class of neural networks which synthesize near-photorealistic samples from a probability distribution learned over a large collection of images.

All of these were generated using their original code, applied to a [caffemodel of Places365](https://github.com/metalbubble/places365). I've selected some of the interesting highlights.

DGNs are capable of producing many unique samples which are pretty convincing. Here is a series of [buttes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte).

Here is a series of boathouses. Notice that the DGN has impressively learned to make the water reflective.

Since many image classes have people in them, they have a tendency to generate people as a strange artifact. Curiously reminiscent of [Mario Klingemann's work with DGNs](https://twitter.com/quasimondo/status/755371321534578688).

You can animate the process of DGN samples converging on a class.
