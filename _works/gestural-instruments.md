Gestural Instruments attempted to develop novel musical instruments with the [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com), a device providing precise hand tracking.

I wrote several synths with [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/), controlling their parameters with the Leap. [Code here](https://github.com/genekogan/LeapMotion-SuperCollider-Instruments). Some highlights:

[Maceda Box](http://www.theunifiedfield.org/archives/3471) was an installation for interacting with the field recordings of Filipino ethnomusicologist, [Jose Maceda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Maceda), created during a residency with [The UnifiedField](http://www.theunifiedfield.org/archives/3471) in Davao City, Philippines. A collection of acoustic fragments spanning the whole of the Philippines and drawing from its varied musical traditions were spatially organized according to acoustic similarity, allowing a user to draw upon the works in an intuitive and playful way with the use of the Leap Motion.
